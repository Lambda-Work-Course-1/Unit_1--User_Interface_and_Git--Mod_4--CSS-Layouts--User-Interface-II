		<h2>Introducing My site!</h2>
		<p>Hey there! You have stumbled onto my portfolio project done while attending Lambda School. I have not done many projects so most of the information here is placeholder text and images.  I am not overly creative so things are basic and colors might clash but I am learning and for me that is what matters! </p>
