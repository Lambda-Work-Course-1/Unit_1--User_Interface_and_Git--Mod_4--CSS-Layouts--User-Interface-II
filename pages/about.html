				Hey! You are really getting around this little project of mine!  For this page  I designed a basic wireframe I thought would be easy to build out.  For the challenge I used an auto generated color pallet! I used this <a href=" https://coolors.co/160f29-246a73-368f8b-f3dfc1-ddbea8" aria-label="Link to color pallet used for site creation" target="_blank"> color pallet</a>. Because these colors are not CSS named colors I was able to take advantage of CSS variables! I am not sure how practical the variables were for this one page. Maybe on another larger project they would be more efficient.
			</p>
				<p>Because I lack confidence in the design portion of web development the pallet made things much easier. This was a valuable lesson on looking for ways to bridge the gaps in knowledge/comfort and crush imposter syndrome.  
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not sure I amd thrilled with what I did with the colors... maybe in time I will grow to be more confidant in design.
			</p>
			<p>
				Again, thanks for checking things out! If you have any feedback I am happy to hear it! I believe that we can only do better if our ideas and creations are challenged.
